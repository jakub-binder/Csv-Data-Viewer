\## Project goals

\- Build a small web app that loads multiple CSV files (semicolon-separated).

\- Each CSV contains a metadata section and a tests table separated by an empty line.

\- UI: switch between loaded files, show pass/fail vs limits on a chart.



\## Coding rules

\- TypeScript preferred.

\- No backend required.

\- Keep parsing robust (handle missing limits, non-numeric values).

\- Add a few unit tests for the parser.

\- Provide clear npm scripts and README instructions.
